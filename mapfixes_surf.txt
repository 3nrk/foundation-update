rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
852889271 - Golden Glory - ramp fix - fall through ramp???
770953991 - Halloween - ramp fix - spines still bad, candy corn stage is unnecessarily hard due to the hitbox, some ramps kill you
10066332884 - O-oh hi-i t-there, J-J-Jill - spawn is buggy, bumpy ramps, especially 2nd ramp
12947656819 - Skewed - the bonus is actually possible for new physics now cuz of a stupid fat wall (fix made by Duckadvice) - stage 2 teleport to stage 3 has a part in the way
621876510 - Space Jam - idk - there is already a great fix published
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
459306841 - Winterland - ramp fix - needs more fixes, still bumpy ramps
4899023713 - surf_Airspace (added extra walls around each stage, starting playforms renamed to "Jump3" - testers saying it's not possible, maybe missing a ramp?

14214740439 - Memorial - rampfix, better lighting & textures, new skybox - the spine fix ruins the surf made of 6 wedges with a concavity underneath
5272229281 - Luminous - made possible - lower the surfs a bit, you can't walk off some spawns onto the surfs
13605711173 - Ineffable - made possible - ramp textures are wack on the ends, map is harder because of tall hitbox
13634743943 - Ineffable 2 - made possible - ramp with z fighting causes physics issues 2 ramps before circle spin thing, map is harder because of tall hitbox
14122828826 - Sandstorm Supergiant - made possible - not adjusted for new physics enough, lighting needs fix
