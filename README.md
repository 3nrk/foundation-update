# I want to fix maps
Give me a list of ids/maps and I will send you up to date map files for whichever maps you want to fix.

## How to propose an edit
1. Navigate the file you want to edit
2. Use the edit button ✏️ and start making your changes
3. Press the green "Commit changes..." button in the top right
4. Write a short commit message (e.g. fix surf_utopia)
5. Click create a new branch
6. Click Propose changes

### I don't want to do any of this
That's ok, you can just DM me the information and I will add it here.
