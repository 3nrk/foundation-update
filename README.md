# I want to fix maps
Give me a list of ids/maps and I will send you up to date map files for whichever maps you want to fix.

## How to send in your edits using github
1. Fork this project using the button on the github page
2. Create a new branch named whatever you like (asdfasdf, borderlands-fix, submission1)
3. Edit mapfixes_bhop.txt or mapfixes_surf.txt with your uploaded model ids, commit your changes to your new branch
4. Make a Pull Request requesting to merge your branch into the main branch in this repository

### I already have a fork, how do I submit more edits
This why you made a new branch the first time.
1. Use the "Sync fork" button on your fork's main branch page to sync the changes so you make your edits on the latest version
2. Go to step 2 (Create a new branch) in the section above

If you didn't make a new branch and have "This branch is 2 commits ahead, 4 commits behind krakow10:main." you will need to fight github to reset your main branch to match the version here so that it's compared to the right version.

### I don't want to do any of this
That's ok, you can just DM me the information and I will add it here.
